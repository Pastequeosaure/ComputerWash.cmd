<summary>🏰 Roglike (Batch Edition)</summary>

A tiny roguelike made entirely in Windows Batch, originally designed as a hidden Easter Egg… and then it became a standalone mini-game!  
Explore the mysterious dungeon rooms, face monsters, manage your gold and keys… and see how far you can get.

<details>
<summary>🎮 Gameplay</summary>

- Move room by room until you reach the dungeon’s end.  
- Each room may hide a random event or a monster (monsters appear every 7 rooms).
